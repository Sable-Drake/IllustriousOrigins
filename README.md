A mod for Starsector that adds new character backgrounds for Nexerelin with unique gameplay effects.

## Description

Illustrious Origins expands the character background system in Nexerelin, providing new starting options that fundamentally change how you interact with the factions of the Persean Sector. Each background comes with detailed intel entries and carefully balanced effects that create unique gameplay experiences.

## Current Backgrounds

### Force of Personality

Your magnetic personality draws factions together, making them believe in a shared vision of the future. Those who align themselves with you find themselves drawn together by a shared vision. Factions that trust you gradually put aside their historical differences, finding common ground they never knew existed.

**Effects:**
- **Alliance Relations**: Factions in alliance with you gradually improve relations with each other over time
- **Permanent Alliances**: Alliances you form become permanent, bound together by unwavering commitment
- **Pre-Alliance Relations**: Factions with strong relations to you (50+) also improve relations with each other at a slower pace
- **Universal Compatibility**: Your magnetic personality allows any faction to join your alliances regardless of their normal alignment compatibility

**Configuration:**
All effects are configurable via LunaLib settings:
- Check Interval: How often relations are improved (default: 30 days)
- Alliance Improvement: Amount of relation improvement for alliance members per interval (default: +2)
- Pre-Alliance Improvement: Amount of relation improvement for pre-alliance factions per interval (default: +1)
